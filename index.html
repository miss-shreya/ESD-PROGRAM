            <h2 id="h2"> ESD PROGRAM</h2>
            <p id="p1">ESD is a  program  which offers internship and jobs .ESD  can help you develop a range of valuable skills that are useful in many different careers, as well as in your everyday life. By learning to program, i can  gain a deeper understanding of how computers work and how they can be used to solve real-world problems.
            <h3>HERE,is the  IMPORTANT THINGS WHICH I HAVE LEARNT  :</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
        Problem-solving skills: Programming requires the ability to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts. By learning to program, you may have developed your problem-solving skills and learned how to approach problems in a logical and systematic way.  </li>
        <li>
            Programming concepts and structures: Programming involves learning the concepts and structures of programming languages, such as variables, data types, control structures, functions, and objects. These concepts help you understand how to write code that is efficient and effective.
        </li>
        <li>
            . Debugging and testing: Writing code is only half the battle. You may have learned how to debug your code and test it to ensure that it works as intended. This involves identifying and fixing errors in your code and testing it to ensure that it produces the desired output.
        </li>
        <li>
            Collaboration and teamwork: this  often involves collaborating with others to develop and maintain software. You may have learned how to work effectively in teams, how to communicate ideas and code changes, and how to use version control systems such as Git.
                </li>
            </ul>
